# Finetuning_BERT_on_NER_conll2003
We are fine tuning two bert models:
1. bert-base-cased(https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased)
2. distilbert-base-uncased(https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased)
on a Named Entity Recognition task using the conll 2003 dataset. The link to the datset is as follows : https://huggingface.co/datasets/conll2003. We are reporting the accuracy and F1 score.
